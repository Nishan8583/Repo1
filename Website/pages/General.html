					<p class = 'content'>15 for PS4. The package features remastered versions of all three PS3 titles running at a silky smooth 1080p/60fps.
					The last game in the series, Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception was released back in 2011, so we’ve been waiting over four years f
					or the continuation of Drake’s story.Hopefully we won’t have much longer to wait
					We have great news for all our Uncharted fans – Amy, Justin and the team are hard at work on an amazing new instalment of the Uncharted series to be released exclusively on the PlayStation 4 system,” said Naughty Dog Community Strategist, Arne Meyer at the original trailer launch back in November 2013.
					“Our goal is to continue what we’ve done in previous console generations and once again deliver the best in storytelling, performance capture, technical innovation and graphics on the PS4. We can confirm that the voiceover is performed by Todd Stashwick and he will play a character in the game.”
					Since the game was announced, Uncharted 4 writer Amy Hennig has left Naughty Dog after working on the Uncharted series for over a decade. The Last of Us developer has since confirmed that her departure will not affect work on Uncharted 4.

					<p class = 'content'>The Recent Terrorist attacks in the us has led the FBI
					to tackle with the APPLE and many other tech giants in order to 
					get pass their encrypted phones and gain acces to the suspects 
					smartphone. This not only violates the suspects personeel records but
					APPLE believes it could be used to gain access to all other APPLE smartphones
					as well.A U.S. magistrate declared that the world’s biggest technology company must build a 
					tool for the FBI to access an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters.
					The legal dispute between Apple and the FBI continues: the government has filed a response to Apple's refusal to cooperate with a federal magistrate's order instructing it to assist the FBI in circumventing the security features on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.
					In their legal filings, Apple and the government face off on a number of issues. Apple says the government is using the court system to assert broad authority that hasn't been granted by Congress; the government says Apple is overstating the wide-reaching security concerns and creating "warrantproof" devices.
					Below, in the words of their own filings, are a few of the issues where the two parties most fiercely disagree(Camila Domonoske,Alina Selyukh,2016)
					Apple says its connection to the case doesn't justify it being "drafted into government service": "Apple is a private company that does not own or possess the phone at
					issue, has no connection to the data that may or may not exist on the phone, and is not related in any way to the events(Camila Domonoske,Alina Selyukh,2016).
